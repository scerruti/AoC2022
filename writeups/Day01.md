# [--- Day 1: Calorie Counting ---](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1)

### Update 12/1/2022
This version is a significant change to the code initially posted because I altered the runner to pass in an list of lines rather than a single string. This list could be converted to an Array if you want to exercise that skill. You can use the version history to see the previous version.

## Summary

This problem demonstrates using an enhanced for loop to travers a List of Strings passed in as a parameter. It could be converted to an Array and the algorithm still works.

## Topics
1. Enhanced for loop
1. Simple maximum value algorithm
1. Combined summation and max value algorithm.
1. Converting strings to integers.

## Deviations from the AP CSA Java Subset

The Java subset does not include a way to covert Strings to Integers. I used the Integer wrapper method parseInt which can be very useful. This could be avoided by using scanner on the input file.
