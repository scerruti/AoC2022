# [--- Day 10: Cathode-Ray Tube ---](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/10)

## Summary
Day 10 gives us a two instruction set computer, sub substrings and modulo. My solution isn't very elegant and this worries me because of experiences with constantly evolving instruction sets.

I make make some improvements tomorrow in preparation for day 11. Other than embedding part 2 in part 1 there isn't much going on.
