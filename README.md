# Advent of Code 2022 for AP CSA

Please see [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) for information about the programming challenges, leaderboards and stats.

## Goal

Each year I attempt to solve the Advent of Code using the AP CSA subset and write up my responses for the benefit of anyone who might want to try to use them as an extension in class.

I make every attempt to note where I have gone outside the lines.

## Write Ups
1. [--- Day 1: Calorie Counting ---](writeups/Day01.md)
    - `Array` algorithms
2. [--- Day 2: Rock Paper Scissors ---](writeups/Day03.md)
    - `If` statements
3. [--- Day 3: Rucksack Reorganization ---](writeups/Day03.md)
    - `String` methods (`substring`, `indexOf`)
    - Iterating over `Lists` and `Strings` multiple ways
4. [--- Day 4: Camp Cleanup ---](writeups/Day04.md)
   - `boolean` expressions
   - AP subset issues for String.split() and Integer.parseInt()
5. [--- Day 5: Supply Stacks ---](writeups/Day05.md)
   - Array and ArrayList algorithms
   - Some string parsing

## Notes

I wanted to use an existing framework to build out the Java code for each day and I chose poorly. Most frameworks for AoC hand the input to a solver method. Because the new [Code.org](https://code.org) AP CSA curriculum uses Scanner against files I may rewrite the early solutions to make use of that. This will remove some substring operations but will provide a subset compliant method for converting input into numeric values.

## Feedback 

Feedback, especially suggestions for improvement, are always welcome. Please find me on mastodon at [@scerruti@csed.social](https://csed.social/@scerruti).
